👋 Hi, I’m Karol, a beginner programmer and IT student. I really enjoy creating websites, both front-end and back-end, and programming in JavaScript and Java. C# is also one of my strengths.
👀 I’m interested in football, programming, and fast cars.
🏫 I’m currently studying at a technical school in Brzesko, Poland.
📚 I have experience programming in Java, JavaScript, Angular, C#, C++, Python, PHP, and MySQL, as well as working with Django. I can also write code in HTML5 and CSS3.
📫 If you’d like to collaborate with me, feel free to send me a message on GitHub.
